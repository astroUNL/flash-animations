Constellations Activity Idea
</p><p>
Present a draggable 3D volume of space filled with stars. Ask students what would that part of the sky look like to an observer at a given location. Ask students to identify asterisms and come up with constellations based on that perspective. Direct students to drag the volume around to see where those bright stars are relative to each other. Ask if it seems the stars making up the constellation are associated in space. (Possible easter egg: have the volume include the stars of the big dipper or other recognizable feature, but don't mention the fact.)
