To add a star use the variables below with a number added to the end of the variable name. Numbering should start at 1 and be consecutive.

If only one of the following variables is defined the star is assumed to be on the main sequence.

mass
lum
temp
rad
type

You can also use a pair of variables to specify the location of a star. Note that the combination must include both an x and y.

temp	x
type	x
rad		xy
lum		y

Style options for the star's point:

label - default is the number of the star
showAsDisc -
	0*- show as a point with the label to the upper right
	1 - show as a larger disc with the label inside the disc
color - default is ff0000 
textColor - default is black when showAsDisc is 1; otherwise, it is the same as "color"
