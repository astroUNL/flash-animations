The function <code>gaussian</code> on the first frame of the main timeline returns a random number that follows a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Note that the function can be modified to produce two guassian random numbers per call. One can use <code>x2*w</code> in the last line of the function as well as <code>x1*w</code>. This function is based on the algorithm found <a href="http://www.taygeta.com/random/gaussian.html">here</a>.
