made two fixes related to the tab (mouse free) mode:
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed it so that tabbing-off the value field does not result in the change handler being called unless the value was being edited</li>
<li>fixed the problem that would cause double incrementing when adjusting the grabber position with the arrow keys</li>
</ul>
<p>
