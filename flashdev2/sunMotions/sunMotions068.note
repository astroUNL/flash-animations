Made the direction labels in the horizon diagram change to all "N"s or all "S"s at the poles.

Note about versions: this version is derived from 066b. I don't know why I made a 066b version instead of a 067 version, but since this is the version that has been on the website for over a year (from July 2009) I think it must be safe to use. I don't know what the difference is between 066 and 066b, but it must be something minor if I didn't want to change the version identity in the About dialog.
