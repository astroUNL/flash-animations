The following animations/simulations need to be fixed for the NAAP Air app. Some items are also used by the ClassAction Air app and will need to be replaced there after updating.

Two common issues:
- drop-downs not working correctly when scaled, even in patched sims (although some patched sims do work *1)
- items added to the stage programmatically with properties will sometimes have incorrect values for the first item added
